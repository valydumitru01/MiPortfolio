            <p>
                Hi! I'm Valentin Dumitru, a student who is one year from becoming a software engineer. I will solve
                almost
                all your problems, except the
                ones I will not solve, which are most of them. I only solve software problems. And I solve them better
                if I
                enjoy solving them, and the ones that I enjoy the most are visual problems such as front end or graphics
                related.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> I work hard and I enjoy working in hard
                    working teams.</span>
            </p>

                My approach on describing myself will be selecting a characteristic I feel is important and then
                expand on it. And also I will show all the proofs I can gather.

                            Yeah, Im a gym bro! Ok maybe not that much, but I do love it. And I love to eat healthy,
                            specially
                            considering that I was obese at one point of my life. I had to go through a strict diet to
                            slim
                            down, I
                            slimmed down 20 kilos in a summer. Through the years I've also been growing in strength and
                            muscle
                            mass,
                            although I also built some of the fat back... But nothing to worry about. I'm still healthy.

                            Sense of humour is definitely one of my strengths. I've definitely made many people laugh

                        <p>
                            Videogames have always been my all time favorite hobby. And they almost always have been
                            technical,
                            competitive and hard games. Specially
                            classy RPG, MMORPGs, Sandbox, Roguelike and I also had a phase of MOBAs.
                            I've played Skyrim, Terraria, Smite, Titan Quest, Diablo III, Minecraft (modded mainly),
                            Divinity
                            Original
                            Sin (1 and 2) and many many others. And the higher the difficulty the better.

                        <p>
                            I also have done some sports throughout my life such as badminton, tennis, football,
                            kickboxing,
                            swimming and hiking. Some of them for a short period of time, but always have given my best.

                            I've always been creative. Since when I was little I was drawing and imagining stuff, and they
                            always
                            said
                            that I had too much imagination. They were wrong. No amount of imagination is too much.

                            I have a great appreciation for my drawings and paintings. It reminds me how perseverance and hard
                            work
                            makes you be the best version of yourself.

                            These are my favorite ones, some are older and worse than the others. I know they are not perfect
                            but
                            they
                            are good to me.
