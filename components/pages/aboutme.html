                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Valentin Dumitru, a student who is one year from becoming a software engineer. I will solve
                almost
                all your problems, except the
                ones I will not solve, which are most of them. I only solve software problems. And I solve them better
                if I
                enjoy solving them, and the ones that I enjoy the most are visual problems such as front end or graphics
                related. I work hard and I enjoy working in hard working teams.
            </p>
            <p>My approach on describing myself will be selecting a characteristic I feel is important and then
                expand on it. And also I will show all the proofs I can gather.

            <p>
                Sense of humour is definitely one of my strengths. I've definitely made many people laugh during my
                lifetime. I enjoy stand up comedy and comedy films. I really like irony, memes, dark humour and anything
                similar and related.

            <p>
                I've always been competitive and I hated to loose. I, of course don't have anger issues when I do, but
                never
                liked it. When I want and like something, I try to improve and work towards reaching it.
            <h4>Videogames</h4>
            <p>
                Videogames have always been my all time favorite hobby. And they almost always have been technical,
                competitive and hard games. Specially
                classy RPG, MMORPGs, Sandbox, Roguelike and I also had a phase of MOBAs.
                I've played Skyrim, Terraria, Smite, Titan Quest, Diablo III, Minecraft (modded mainly), Divinity
                Original
                Sin (1 and 2) and many many others. And the higher the difficulty the better.

            <p>
                I've always been creative. Since when I was little I was drawing and imagining stuff, and they always
                said
                that I had too much imagination. They were wrong. No amount of imagination is too much.

                My Drawings and Paintings
            </h4>
            <p>
                I have a great appreciation for my drawings and paintings. It reminds me how perseverance and hard work
                makes you be the best version of yourself.
                <br>
                These are my favorite ones, some are older and worse than the others. I know they are not perfect but
                they
                are good to me.
